## Bengaluru House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
The Bengaluru House Price Prediction Project! In this project, we have developed a machine learning model using linear regression to predict house prices in the vibrant city of Bengaluru. Our model takes various features related to houses as input and provides an estimated price as output.

### Introduction
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices in Bengaluru. By utilizing a linear regression approach, we harness the power of machine learning to analyze the relationships between various features and the final price of a house.

### Techniques Used
1. Data Cleaning: We began by thoroughly cleaning the raw data to ensure accuracy and reliability throughout the project.
2. Feature Engineering: We extracted valuable information from the dataset to create new features that enhance the predictive power of the model.
3. One Hot Encoding: Categorical variables were transformed using one-hot encoding to make them suitable for input into our model.
4. Dimensionality Reduction: To reduce complexity and enhance efficiency, we applied dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
5. Outlier Removal: Outliers can distort the model's performance. We identified and removed outliers to improve the robustness of our predictions.
6. GridSearch CV: We utilized GridSearch CV to find the optimal hyperparameters for our linear regression model, thus improving its accuracy.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Python (version 3)
2. Jupyter Notebook or any preferred Python development environment
3. Required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, etc.). Install them using 'pip' or 'conda'.
